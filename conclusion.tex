\section{Conclusion}

In today's web, CAPTCHA systems are the deciding factor in weather a user should
be able to access a service or not. Every false positive makes the web less
accessible and even a single challenge posed to persons with disabilities makes
the web inaccessible entire to groups of users. Also, the
ubiquitous presence of privacy-invasive systems like reCAPTCHA post serious
threats to the internet and its users as right to access to information is
now determined by single entity using an opaque process.

So it is imperative that future system designers take these factors into
consideration. We believe mCaptcha is an attempt at making the web more
accessible while securing it with a decentralised command structure.
