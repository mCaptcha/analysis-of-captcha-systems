\subsection{Noisy Text}

\subsubsection{Privacy}
Excellent\\
The method doesn't employ any tracking elements and works when used in anonymous
networks like TOR\@.

\subsubsection{Effectiveness}
Bad\\
The method relies on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities of human
users. OCR technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated which would render
this method ineffective in the future.

Without OCR, this method can be bypassed using human-powered CAPTCHA farms with

ease.
\subsubsection{Accessibility}
Bad\\
Since the method relies on OCR, it is inaccessible to users with visual
disabilities and the added noise poses challenges to users with cognitive
disabilities. The noise sometimes makes the challenge unsolvable which results
in failures for even users without any disabilities,
\subsubsection{Accuracy}
Good\\
Success and failure are absolute states in this method. A solution that doesn't
match the challenge text results in failure while a match is considered a
success. But when using employing CAPTCHA farms for circumvention, the method
fails absolutely.

The method uses only text matches in its decision process. No other
external factors are involved.
