\subsection{Align Object}

\subsubsection{Privacy}
Excellent\\
The method doesn't employ any tracking elements and works when used in anonymous
networks like TOR\@.

\subsubsection{Effectiveness}
Bad\\
The method relies on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities of human
users. OCR technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated which would render
this method ineffective in the future.

Without OCR, this method can be bypassed using human-powered CAPTCHA farms with

ease.
\subsubsection{Accessibility}
Bad\\
Since the method relies on OCR, it is inaccessible to users with visual and
cognitive disabilities.
\subsubsection{Accuracy}
Good\\
Success and failure are absolute states in this method. A misaligned object
results in failure while a properly aligned object succeeds. But when using
employing CAPTCHA farms for circumvention, the method fails absolutely.

The method uses only the object alignment in its decision process. No other
external factors are involved.
